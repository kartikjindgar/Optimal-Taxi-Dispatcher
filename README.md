# Optimal-Taxi-Dispatcher
*Using Reinforcement Learning to optimize Taxi Dispatch system in New York City.*

Meeting demand efficiently lies at the crux of most ride-sharing businesses. 
It is essential to dispatch cabs with the not only the goal to satisfy customer demand, but also minimize travel costs and customer waiting times. 
This kind of problem is difficult to solve using general supervised learning methods because we need to be able to capture changing cab distributions with each action taken, in order to learn the best overall dispatch strategy.  

> Goal:  Train an agent to optimally dispatch cabs in Manhattan, based on live demand.
